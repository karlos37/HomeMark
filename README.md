Notes  
1. Rotation does not work currently in pc but works on Android phones due to an issue with multiplayer and multiple event systems.
2. There are some issues faced when you download the project and load the scene ( like missing Prefabs and missing scripts). This issue is related to git integration with
    Unity and we are not able to figure out a fix for it yet.
